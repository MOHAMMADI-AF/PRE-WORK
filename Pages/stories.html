  <h2>More about Mohammad Akbar MOHAMMADI</h2>

  <p> My name is Mohammad Akbar MOHAMMADI. On this website, you will get to know me briefly. You can call me Akbar in
    class. I am 47 years old and passionate about computer science and technology. I enjoy learning about the latest
    tech that comes out. I was born in Kabul, Afghanistan and now live in New York City with my family of six.</p>
  <p> My goal for the future is to complete my education in the field of computer science and hopefully get a job that I
    am passionate about it.</p>
  <p>I was born in 1975 in Kabul, Afghanistan.
    I spent my childhood, teenage, and precious adult time in Kabul City capital of Afghanistan, and enjoyed my life
    with my family and friend. I got married in 2005. I worked with IOM as an IT personnel in Kabul, Afghanistan, loved
    my job, and was excited to learn new skills every day.</p>
  <p> I left Afghanistan in 2014 and came to New York City with my family. I have worked in the Afghanistan consulate
    for over seven years as a Passport & Visa issuing Specialist. Furthermore, I have been living in New York for eight
    years.</p>
  <p> I do not know how to write code (software development); therefore, I have joined PER SCHOLAS Software Engineering
    Class to learn a new field in Information Systems Managment. It will help me go forward and have a brighter future.
